# ML-Capstone
ML project description!

## Overview
State the problem, the dataset, and the objective. Describe the stakeholder and the decision supported by the model.

## Dataset
Link to the source and license. Explain collection, schema, fields, units, and any filters or joins. Provide a script or instructions to access data.

## Methods
Outline preprocessing, feature engineering, baseline model, and improved model. State validation plan, hyperparameter search, and steps to prevent leakage.

## Results
Report metrics that match the use case. Include figures for performance and interpretability. Compare baseline and improved model and state practical meaning of errors.

## Reproducibility
List environment setup and commands to run the pipeline or notebooks. Set random seeds where possible and record dataset version and split seeds.

## Poster
There is a poster in the `results` folder
